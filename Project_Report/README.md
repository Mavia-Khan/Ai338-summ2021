"The linear SVM classifier works by drawing a straight line between two classes. All the data points that fall on one side of the line will be labeled as one class and all the points that fall on the other side will be labeled as the second. Sounds simple enough, but there’s an infinite amount of lines to choose from. How do we know which line will do the best job of classifying the data? This is where the LSVM algorithm comes in to play. The LSVM algorithm will select a line that not only separates the two classes but stays as far away from the closest samples as possible. In fact, the “support vector” in “support vector machine” refers to two position vectors drawn from the origin to the points which dictate the decision boundary."
